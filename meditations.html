        <div class="w3-container">
            <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Introduction</b></h5>
            <p>&emsp;Recently I've been thinking a lot about the gospel. Is it simple? Is it complex? How can we define it? Seeing as it is the focal point of all Christian doctrine,
            I thought it would be wise to at least attempt to describe it. Upon attempting to define the gospel, I always find it necessary to discourage certain assumptions that
            I've made a habit of holding. So I also intend to transition into more of an exhortative tone, in order to dispel some of those assumptions.</p>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Evangelion</b></h5>
            <p>&emsp;So, to begin, let's start with the definition of "the gospel". In the Greek, it means "good news" - And the good news is pretty simple, though one could dive into the endless complexities and facets of it. It is stated succinctly in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
[1] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; <br>
[2] By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. <br>
[3] For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; <br>
[4] And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>The "Bad News"</b></h5>
            <p>&emsp;These verses sound pretty good, right? But what does it mean exactly mean? Why is this good news? What in this news is good for each party involved. For God, for men, and for *me*, and
	for *you*? To understand why the gospel is good, we must first be made aware of our helpless state, and depraved condition. In other words, we need to have the bad news before
	we can have the good news and can understand it. You don't have to go too far in Man's history to find the bad news. Genesis 3 gives the account of Man's
	disobedience in the garden. And Adam and Eve's disobedience is something that we all inherit being part of his race, Adam's race. Psalm 51:5 shows that, even from birth, we bear
	the sin nature which casts us out of God's paradise. </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
[5] Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>God's Providence</b></h5>
            <p>&emsp;But thanks be to God that we find the "Good News" very early on in scripture as well, even in the same chapter as the fall of man.
            In Genesis 3:15 we have what is called the "protoevangelium", or, "the first gospel":</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
[15] And I will put enmity between thee [the serpent] and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&emsp;God, knowing all things, already had a plan for salvation. We even see it prefigured again a couple verses later, Genesis 3:21:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
[21] Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&emsp;So quickly in scripture, it is revealed that God's plan for salvation will not be without cost. The bruising of the heel and the sacrifice of the animals to make coats of skin... how strange that these should be the method of salvation.</p>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>The Unfitting, Contradicting Medium of God's Grace</b></h5>
            <p>&emsp;I believe that it is precisely in this giving of salvation through loss, and distribution of good through evil, that we find the beauty of the gospel.</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa fa-circle-o fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue-grey"></i>Atonement</h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
            <p>&emsp;Perhaps the most central doctrine in Christian soteriology, yea, in all of Christianity, is the atonement accomplished through Jesus Christ.
Atonement. It's a word that very often flies over our heads, and because of that, we may fail to meditate on what it is, and by what means it was accomplished.
Foregoing a linguistic analysis of the biblical terms ascribed to atonement, I think a fair definition for all sides of the matter would be simply "reconciliation".
Now what do I mean by "all sides of the matter"? It may surprise you, as it shocked me, that not all hold to a doctrine of penal substitutionary atonement.
To give a brief definition: "penal", meaning penalty, referring to the debt of sin that we owed; "substitutionary", meaning in the place of, speaking of Christ taking our place;
and "atonement", meaning reconciliation as previously described. Growing up with a protestant background, I found myself immediately thinking,
"whoever does not hold these basic truths of the atonement is hardly Christian".
I was surprised to find some thought the doctrine was reprehensible, and not at all in line with traditional Christian theology, or with the scripture.
Instead some ascribe to the idea of "Christus Victor", describing how Christ liberated us from slavery to Satan, but do not believe that the wrath of God was poured upon Christ on the cross.
And there are other theories as well, such as the "redemption theory", and a variety of others. Now, I believe most protestants would be in agreement that the atonement does in fact have
a variety of aspects in how it was accomplished, and I don't imagine most having an issue saying, "Christ conquered death", or "Christ redeemed us from slavery to Satan". So it would seem
protestants hold that these aspects are complimentary rather than contradicting. But Catholics and other opponents seem to hold that penal substitutionary atonement (*PSA, from now on),
is incompatible with Christian tradition and scripture.
<br><br>
&emsp;One of the issues they bring up with PSA, is that it leaves no room for forgiveness of sins. This is a problem indeed! For we know that God forgives us our sins. And if the penalty is paid
for on the cross, then it is no longer forgiveness, but payment. I would answer this objection with the parable in Matthew 18:23-34. The servant was forgiven his debt. The charge accounted
to him was forgoed. "Aha, There it is! PSA is dismantled, for there was no transfer of penalty." one might claim. But if we consider carefully, indeed the penalty was paid for. The King
who forgave was the one who suffered loss. And is it not the same with the cross? God has been greatly offended by the sins and transgressions of man, his creation. And we know God is just,
for the soul that sinneth, it shall die. So for God to simply forgive the sinner leaves the question of justice wanting. So we see God take the penalty for our sins, and places them upon
Himself. Let me be clear to say that I hold the doctrine of the trinity, and we know that God the Father placed the penalty for our sins on God the Son. But for the sake of the parable, it
is more clear to say God places that debt upon Himself. So God forgives, but also, there is payment, because He Himself suffers the debt, and pays it in full, in the man Christ Jesus.</p>
