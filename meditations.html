        <div class="w3-container">
            <p>Perhaps the most central doctrine in Christian soteriology, yea, in all of Christianity, is the atonement accomplished through Jesus Christ.
Atonement. It's a word that very often flies over our heads, and because of that, we may fail to meditate on what it is, and by what means it was accomplished.
Foregoing a linguistic analysis of the biblical terms ascribed to atonement, I think a fair definition for all sides of the matter would be simply "reconciliation".
Now what do I mean by "all sides of the matter"? It may suprise you, as it shocked me, that not all hold to a doctrine of penal substitutionary atonement.
To give a brief definition: "penal", meaning penalty, refering to the debt of sin that we owed; "substitutionary", meaning in the place of, speaking of Christ taking our place;
and "atonement", meaning reconciliation as previously described. Growing up with a protestant background, I found myself immediately thinking,
"whoever does not hold these basic truths of the atonement is hardly Christian".
I was suprised to find some thought the doctrine was reprehensible, and not at all in line with traditional Christian theology, or with the scripture.
Instead some ascribe to the idea of "Christus Victor", describing how Christ liberated us from slavery to Satan, but do not believe that the wrath of God was poured upon Christ on the cross.
And there are other theories as well, such as the "redemption theory", and a variety of others. Now, I believe most protestants would be in agreement that the atonement does in fact have
a variety of aspects in how it was accomplished, and I don't imagine most having an issue saying, "Christ conquered death", or "Christ redeemed us from slavery to Satan". So it would seem
protestants hold that these aspects are complimentary rather than contradicting. But Catholics and other opponents seem to hold that penal substitutionary atonement (*PSA, from now on),
is incompatible with Christian tradition and scripture.
<br><br>
One of the issues they bring up with PSA, is that it leaves no room for forgiveness of sins. This is a problem indeed! For we know that God forgives us our sins. And if the penalty is paid
for on the cross, then it is no longer forgiveness, but payment. I would answer this objection with the parable in Matthew 18:23-34. The servant was forgiven his debt. The charge accounted
to him was forgoed. "Aha, There it is! PSA is dismantled, for there was no transfer of penalty." one might claim. But if we consider carefully, indeed the penalty was paid for. The King
who forgave was the one who suffered loss. And is it not the same with the cross? God has been greatly offended by the sins and transgressions of man, his creation. And we know God is just,
for the soul that sinneth, it shall die. So for God to simply forgive the sinner leaves the question of justice wanting. So we see God take the penalty for our sins, and places them upon
Himself. Let me be clear to say that I hold the doctrine of the trinity, and we know that God the Father placed the penalty for our sins on God the Son. But for the sake of the parable, it
is more clear to say God places that debt upon Himself. So God forgives, but also, there is payment, because He Himself suffers the debt, and pays it in full, in the man Christ Jesus.</p>
